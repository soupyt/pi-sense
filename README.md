# pi-sense
A command-line tool to access the basic sensors on the AstroPi Sense HAT

## Usage
`sense <comp|align|humid|temp>`

## Defaults
* Displays the temperature in Fahrenheit
* Uses the pressure sensor for temperature (as the humidity sensor seems very unreliable)
* `align` returns a simple compass bearing
